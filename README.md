# Portfolio

This is my portfolio site, made in HTML/CSS as a side project started in my grade 10 year.

This website includes my resume, blog posts, as well as projects I've worked and will be working on in the future.

I've recently moved my actual portfolio over to the `site` repository, that uses a better design using ruby gems.
