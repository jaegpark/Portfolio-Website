# PublicProfile
This is my public profile, made in HTML/CSS as a side project thorughout my grade 11 year.

This website will include my resume, who I am, as well as projects I've worked and will be working on in the future.
An ICS4U0 tutorial may also be included, as I created one for an assignment in my ICS4U0 course. 

I also hope to create a blog over the summer, recording my experiences during the last summer break of high school.
