# PublicProfile
This is my public profile, made in HTML/CSS as a side project started in my grade 11 year.

This website will include my resume, who I am, as well as projects I've worked and will be working on in the future.

I also hope to create a blog over the summer, recording my experiences during the last summer break of high school.
