      <br>
      <article>
        <p>
          After learning my first programming language, Turing, I made a "Simon Says" game. The source code can be found on my github:

      <h2>Java - ICS3U3 ISP</h2>
      <br>
      <article>
        <p>
          Evolving from the basics of Turing, I learnt the Java language in my grade 11 ICS course, where I made an program for managing
          theatre seating inside a 30 x 20 theatre seating map.

          New concepts that were used in this project were file input/output, and 2d-array manipulation. The source code can be found on my github:

      <h2>Competitve Programming</h2>
      <br>
      <article>
        <p>
          After learning Java, I began branching out into the world of competitve programming. Starting with basic problems on the DMOJ
          online problem site, I moved on to the school online judge WLMOJ. I am currently ranked 11th in our school, and a few of my
          solutions to very challenging problems can be found on my Github repository.

      <h2>Java - ICS4U0 Final Project</h2>
      <br>
      <article>
        <p>
          For my final project in this course, Rohan K and I created a 3-level educational game on fire safety. It focused on
          fire safety, fire prevention, and fire fighting. Created in Java, this month long project allowed me to explore various Java classes such as
          Graphics, swing and awt libraries.
