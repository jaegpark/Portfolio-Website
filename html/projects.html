          <br>
          <p>
            My name is Jaegwan Park, and I am a grade 11 student attending the MaCS Program, specializing in math
            and computer science at William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute. You can call me Jae.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a STEM enthusiast, I've been actively engaged in STEM related activities at school,
            such as our science club, programming team, and HOSA. A detailed list of my activities
            inside and outside of school can be found below.

        <h2>Personality Test</h2>
        <br>
          <p>Through the Keirsey and the 16 Personalities personality tests, Iâ€™ve discovered I carry an entrepreneur personality (ESTP) and a guardian personality.
            In quick summary, ESTP people tend to love action and take initiative when they are interested in a subject. They act directly on the facts that they are presented,
            rather than their emotional compulsions. They are pragmatic and toughminded. ESTPs are often leaders that like to get things done, and prefer practical, action-oriented teams to work with.
            They bring lots of energy and are not bored easily during a task. Below, you can find a picture that summarizes the results of my 16-personalities test.

            Outside of school, I have many hobbies that include learning new maths, competitive programming, and listening to classical music.
            I am a certified lifeguard, and I hope to gain a summer job at my local pool this year.
